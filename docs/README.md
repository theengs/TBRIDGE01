## Theengs Bridge, Easy Setup Guide

Discover the **Theengs Bridge**, a smart Bridge and BLE gateway in one device. This guide will help you quickly connect your Bridge to an MQTT broker.

1. **Plug it in**: Connect the device to a 5V USB-C power supply. An orange LED will turn on steadily.

2. **Connect to WiFi**: On your smartphone, search for a WiFi network starting with `OMG_`.
Alternatively, you can connect an ethernet cable to the bridge and access the configuration by typing the bridge IP into a browser (the bridge IP can be found on your router or by a serial connection)

::: tip
If your smartphone disconnects from the Bridge's WiFi network and reconnects to your main WiFi, "forget" your main WiFi to maintain a stable connection with the Bridge. After configuration, reconnect to your main WiFi. If the configuration portal doesn't appear, access it at `192.168.4.1` in your web browser.

4. **Configure WiFi**: Click on "Configure WiFi".

5. **Enter your settings**: Fill in the following required details:
* Your WiFi Access Point (SSID - optional if ethernet connected)
* Your WiFi password (Password - optional if ethernet connected)
* Your MQTT server
* Your MQTT port

Optionally, adjust the following settings if needed:
* MQTT user
* MQTT password
* Secure connection and certificates (if required)
* Gateway name
* Base topic
* Password (this password will be used for configuration portal and Over The Air updates)

::: tip
When using the bridge with ethernet, entering WiFi Access Point and Password will enable to have a fallback connection network if ethernet is disconnect.

6. **Save**: Click on Save.

When connected, the bridge first LED should turn green and second LED will blink blue during scanning.

For further integration with a Home Automation Controller, refer to the [OpenMQTTGateway documentation](https://docs.openmqttgateway.com/use/ble.html).

::: tip
To reset the parameters, access the bridge portal through its IP address (login: admin, default password: OTAPASSWORD). The WiFi configuration portal will then be available (step 2).
